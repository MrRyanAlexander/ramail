<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and I saw your post on Craigslist for an Android Developer. I have mostly written code for iOS in Objective-C, but I would love the challenge of learning more Java - I have written Java before - and to work with others like me who actually just love doing this stuff for fun and earn the rewards of great pay as a bi-product. I am above entry level, but far from being a master of this art. That is the fun part because I still have so many exciting challenges to overcome and who knows what I might think up in time. Anyway, I am a very devoted and hard working person who is active and hunting for the right group to play around with. I try not to take myself or my work too serious, but I take pride in doing the best job. My github, https://github.com/mrryanalexander shows several examples of my work. I also blog https://mrryanalexander.github.io, but having just switched to Jekyll(https://github.com/mrryanalexander/mrryanalexander.github.io.git), I am not done writing more posts. 

<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
