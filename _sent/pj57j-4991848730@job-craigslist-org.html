<h1>Hello FUZE</h1>
Being an instructor sounds fun. People say I should be a teacher and I always laugh because I cannot see it myself, but your ad jumped out at me and for the last hour I have had the tab opened, waiting for your ad to come back around for me to reply. I just get on and open tabs for jobs that sound interesting and reply, one-by-one. Now the thing is, I love coding and in 2012 I dove in head first. The one thing I have learned is that I will learn more by doing more and what better way to learn more than to show other people who I already know and wait for them to ask me things that force me to find the answer. Ha, who would have thunk? I love all things WEB and I LOVE iOS.
<code>
<pre>
Dude *me = [[Dude allow]initWithPower:invincibility];
[self dude:me drink:beer];
- (void)dude:(Dude*)dude drink:(Beverage*)beverage {
	dude.bloodA += beverage.alcohol;
	if(!dude.bloodA >= 0.08) {
		[self dude:dude drink:beverage];
	}
}
</pre>

<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
