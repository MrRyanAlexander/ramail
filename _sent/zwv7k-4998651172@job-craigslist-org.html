<h1>Hello</h1>
Why hire me? Um because I love iOS and can write awesome reusable code. I'm known to stay up late and obsess over my code too, but whatever; you want to know how I can help you. 

I joined the Apple Developer Program last year and just renewed last month. I submitted my first game, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloxz2d/id900677675?mt=8 last summer and it was approved. That was a lengthy process, but I was glad to have made it though all of the steps. 

I created an App Store Clone https://github.com/MrRyanAlexander/YSHorizontalTableViewExample

I am ready to learn more about iOS and one thing you might like about me is that I can appreciate the small things. Things like the fact that NS only exists because Steve Jobs was fired from Apple. I wonder if we would even have iPhones today had it not been for the fact that Apple thought he was too progressive, fired him and forced him to pursue his ideas creating a new company. 

<h2>Hire Mr. Simple!</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
