<h1>Hello</h1>
Why are you still using phpmyadmin? 

Do you want someone who will challenge you, push you to update and upgrade and someone who knows front end and back end developent like the back of his hand? 

You need a non-college grad like me, who is self driven and taught himself everything he knows about code. 

<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
