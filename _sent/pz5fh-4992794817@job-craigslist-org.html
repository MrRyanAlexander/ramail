<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and I saw your post on Craigslist for a "Front End Web Programmer". For a 14 year old company you have not seemed to stay ahead of the curve. You should have moved on from using PHP a while ago, but I digress. Interested in knowing more? Hire me and pay me to show you the new and better ways of doing things. Lets just say that there is a massie community of people out there working on stuff that will drastically improve your stack. I basically take any part of my work that can be resued and find a way to make it modular. That includes writing the same code over and over just to build websites. Yeoman is like a superhero here because all you have to do is setup generators that link to the right paths and like magic, half of the work is done. As far as maintaining Magento is concerned, you may have a little trouble finding someone interested in that with all of the newer and better options available now. If you are stuck on that, maybe try the YMCA, I am sure some retired engineers getting the swim in might know a thing or two, if they still remember. LOL 

<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
