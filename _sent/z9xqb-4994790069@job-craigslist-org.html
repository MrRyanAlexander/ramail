<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and I saw your post on Craigslist for a Junior Web Developer. I am currently looking for work in that area doing work that will help me advance my skills by challenging me with advanced projects. You have indicated that you're in need of someone with PHP and HTML experience, as well as having worked with phpmyadmin. Can I ask why you are using such an old tool and not to mention something free? Are you aware that there are many better ways, (https://parse.com, https://aws.amazon.com, https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/) to maintain a database today? No those tools are not 100% free, but they are very stable and can be scaled to millions-billions-? of users. For example, Netflix scales everyday to stream video Globally; http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix/
<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I would be interested in taking over existing projects if I can make changes as needed and we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
