<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and my extensive knowledge of programming gives me the freedom to do what I want. I do not bind myself to rules or accept that one way is the only way. You are only looking for someone with very basic web development skills and I would like to be challenged. If you happen to have some work that is hard, please continue reading this and review my resume.  

I code in any language and have a lot of work to back up what I know, plus I can write apps on napkins. 

Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
