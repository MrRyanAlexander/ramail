<h1>Hello</h1>
Ok GLAMSQUAD! That is one hell of a name btw. So I noticed that you are currently directing customers on platforms other than iOS to the BOOK NOW link on your website. I assume that to mean you don't have an Android app yet? Bet you're working on one though, huh? Well I would like to bring my skills to a team that will allow me to be creative and offer my full set of skills. My skills include everything from Front-End to Back-End dev to writing apps to end repetative cycles; like my damn email app, https://github.com/MrRyanAlexander/ramail. 

I bring a fun personallity, self motivation and a desire to learn by challenging myself with unknown areas. 

Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
