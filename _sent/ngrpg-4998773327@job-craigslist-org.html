<h1>Hello</h1>
Hire a guy who already knows most of the front-end .js frameworks and who is excited to learn more and write his own. 

My name is Ryan and I never get tired of code. I do not come from a college, I just learned it on my own. So you can expect that I can write for loops in more than one language or just hand me a napkin and a crayon asking me to write an app you can type up and execute. 

Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
