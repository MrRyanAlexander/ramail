<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and I think my background would prove useful to you. Having grown up around an uncle who invested in real estate during the housing boom and working on the ground with him rehabbing the homes - I think when you couple that and my current programming knowlege togther - a simple recipe for awesome comes to life. I am very useful and you will find that no matter how hard a challenge becomes, I manage to find some type of ridiculously simple solution. I guess being very logical and realistic helps? My background working with Amazon Web Services, Parse, Google App Engine and others will become a valuable asset to your stack, if hired. I write Python and love Bash scripts. No longer must one continue typing apt get install "name" and the rest of the garbage that repeats itself next. 

<h2>Hire Mr. Simple!</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
