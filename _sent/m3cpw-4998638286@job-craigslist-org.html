<h1>Hello</h1>
So I get that you're just looking for a web designer/developer to manage and update existing projects or even create new ones all together. I'd be more interested in talking to you about embedded devices since you make actual devices. Please have a brief of my resume, the links included of my work and keep an open mind towards what you see me being capable of. I pick up on things very fast and have a knack for bright ideas. All I know is being hungry, doing my best and being very logical.  

<h2>Hire Mr. Simple!</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
