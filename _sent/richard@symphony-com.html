<h1>Hello</h1>
You should hire me because I will learn everything about your system and become one of your best Engineers. Hi, my name is Ryan and I found your job listing on Craigslist. Then I took a minute to visit your website. Congrats on winning your first award, I am sure you will earn more. Your area of work is interesting, I wasn't thinking about working on security or even aware of the opportunity you have obviously carved out. Maybe I could join you and be there at the next conference like Box. You guys look like a fun team and I can't wait to join my first team of like minded engineers; being alone is getting boring. LOL 

Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
