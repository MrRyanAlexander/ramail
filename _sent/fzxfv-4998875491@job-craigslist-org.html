<h1>Hello</h1>
Ok DW360, first let me say that I really like some of your work. specifically how you show a full screen video at the top. However; on your main website http://digitalwire360.com you have a shit load of errors showing up in the console and the layout is not 100% responsive. The x-slider-revolution-container needs to become more responsive. If you open the developer tools in Chrome and switch to the mobile display, you'll notice that for small screens the x-slider is a black screen. Also your masterhead div doesn't make sense. Why are you showing a hamburger when the masterhead is at the bottom of the screen and why doesn't the masterhead become fixed when it scrolls to the top? Those are just some thoughts I had reviewing your website. 

I would love to hear more about the work you do and discuss how I can help make things better. 

Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
