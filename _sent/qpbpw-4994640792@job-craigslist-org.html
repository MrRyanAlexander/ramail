<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and I saw your post on Craigslist Front End Web Designer/Devloper. I think you would be glad to bring me into your team because I bring a lot to the table. First, I have a lot of experience writing "HTML", CSS(3, SCSS, LESS), PHP(Javascript will kick its ass thanks to Node.js and the NPM), Wordpress(I prefer to use something static like Jekyll - https://github.com/mrryanalexander/mrryanalexander.github.io.git) and jQuery is just Javascript. I watched YouTube videos to learn how to use Photoshop in about 30 minutes and was taking full advantage of the assets generation features by creating a file structure right from the layers panel by properly naming my objects. However; I really have no need for that with GIMP and fun SVG tools like, http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stable/editor/svg-editor.html. 
I could keep listing things off, but that is going to bore the shit out of you soon enough. I am a simple guy, but I like beer, cool peole who like coding and working on my own projects in my free time. I am also into open source work, but not currently active on any teams. 
<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
