<h1>Hello</h1>
You should capitalize Apple when you mention it. Apple is all about perfection and if you even try to submit an app to the App Store without following every guideline, it will be rejected. Anyway, it bugs me when I see grammar errors on job listings. Companies are supposed to hire people who do better work than that. 

I am probably too good for your company. I code in any language and have a lot of work to back up what I know, plus I can write apps on napkins. 

Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files.

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
