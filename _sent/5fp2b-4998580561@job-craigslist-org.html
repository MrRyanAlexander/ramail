<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan and I love thinking about how to visually display content to end users. I am in love with minimalist approaches and to see an example of that have a look at my site, https://mrryanalexander.github.io

Please pay special attention to the compressed version of the main.css file; http://ryan-alex.com/css/main.css and the originals here; https://github.com/MrRyanAlexander/mrryanalexander.github.io/tree/master/_sass

Note that this website is responsive and has 0 dependencies. The _base.scss,  _layout.scss and _syntax_highlighting.scss are the only styling files. 

Ryan-Alex.com is also a Jeykll site generated by pushing my source files into the corrently named repo; https://github.com/MrRyanAlexander/mrryanalexander.github.io

I love messing around with graphics too and with CSS3 and some old tricks; this is an area I can obsess over sometimes, even though my final product is minimalist. SVG's are fun: http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stable/editor/svg-editor.html

I am looking for a great team to work with on exciting new projects. I love coding and want to invest my time being around people who are equally passionate about tech. I have all sorts of experience writing web based code, among other things. You will find more links in my resume.  

I would be a great addition to your team!   

<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
