<h1>Hello</h1>
Are you serious? 25 hours a week, 2K monthly and you even want this person to drive through this nightmare of traffic here just for that? What is the catch? Is there room to grow and earn more within 90 days? Like triple the wages and the same or less hours? 

Oh I am a little devil alright and I write apps on napkins. 

<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
