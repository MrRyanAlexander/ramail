<h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Ryan I am looking for a great team to work with on exciting new projects. I love coding and want to invest my time being around people who are equally passionate about tech. I have all sorts of experience writing web based code, among other things. Recently I converted my site, http://ryan-alex.com, into a Jekyll and started hosting it as my github page https://github.com/mrryanalexander/mrryanalexander.github.io.git 

I would be a great addition to your team!   

<h2>Do you want to talk to me?</h2>
Please review one of my attached resumes, as I have included both  Word.docx and PDF versions for your convenience. Further you will find several links to working examples and to source files. I may be interested if we can agree on terms.
<h3>All the best, Ryan</h3>
